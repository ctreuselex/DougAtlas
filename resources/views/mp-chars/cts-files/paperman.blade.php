        PSYINTERVIEW RECORD NO. 52
        <br>INTERVIEWER: <span class="cts-george"></span>
        <br>INTERVIEWEE: Avery Gebsen AGE: 18
        <br>TIME: 1686, SR 11th Fall
        <br>ATTACHMENT: 1686TD:PsyInterview69:AveryGebsen.avi
        <br>
        <br>Avery Gebsen, son of well... Mr and Mrs. Gebsen.
        <br>Sorry, his parents' names kinda slipped out of my mind. I don't know, I can't hear him properly so I'd rather not type in their names.
        <br>
        <br>Avery is well, an average kid. He has the ability to fold papers into shapes with his Myst Manipulations. I remember Zaldy folding origamis as one of her hobbies, but I also remember her hobbies doing nothing else aside from getting wet and making her mad with rage, so I really don't see any point to this. However, it seem like Skyforge already has their eyes on him, seeing as he is already in possession of one of their weapons; the Biblumancer. It's shit. But it's Tauroscene and who'd know what it can do? I actually want to know. This kid has a lot of mystery around him.
        <br>
        <br>He's also extremely, but secretly, perverted.
        <br>
        <br>CONCLUSION: Let's hire him. I don't want to get insomia thinking why the hell this kid has a Tauroscene weapon while only being able to fold papers. Like. How?

        <br>You could've had him show what the weapon does?

        <br>Met the kid, he really is perverted.
        <br>Also the weapon farts poison. You don't want that shit in the interview room.
