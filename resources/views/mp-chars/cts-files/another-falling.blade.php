        INTERVIEWER: <span class="cts-dian"></span> of Midring Republic Times
        <br>INTERVIEWEE: Ice Queen, <span class="cts-kianna"></span>
        <br>ABOUT: INTERVIEW WITH THE QUEEN!
        <br>TIME: 1696, SR 4th Summer
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: So, Kianna, after serving the Mandalas for almost your entire life, how does it feel now that you're 'The Ice Queen'?
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: It's like a dream come true actually. I never really thought I'd get this far, all I ever wanted was to follow my mother's dreams.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Oh. Your mother was once an Ice Queen too? Which one is her?
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: Actually she's not...
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: I never met her...
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: All she had for me was a note, telling me to pursue and survive... after leaving me on the front door of the cathedral.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Sorry about that. I'm sure she has her reasons.
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: But well, whatever those reasons may be. The deed was done, and I believe she did took me to the right path.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Of course.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Now, are you ready for some questions?
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: Sure, go on.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Amelia has been... very generous. In fact, she almost gave her entire life into serving the people of Mirrorplane. But, there are some people, especially the Dominion, who is not very happy about her 'extreme generosity'. They say that her reign left the economy on the brink of collapse and that the only way to fix this is to take back what was given. Do you approve of this?
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: No. They are wron-
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: We may look into the suggestion more as a way to see more... of the... other posible actions and effects. Ice Queen Amelia commited herself into bringing happiness and balance all throughout Mirrorplane, whether you're from the Dominion or from the lower ring, she pushed herself into reaching people she can help no matter where they're from.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: So, just to clarify. Are you going to continue catering for the lower ring or suspend your resources to balance the city's economy?
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: I... Me, and the rest of the Children of Mandalas will continue to find ways for this to work for everyone. I can't guarantee an instant solution to this right after-
        <br><span class="cts-lance"></span>: As the Ice Queen said, we'll look into the suggestion. 
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: Yes. Thanks Lance. What she said.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Right. Another thing...
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: There was a big controversy regarding your rise to power. We know that all the previous Ice Queens ascend to the heavens with the King after being replaced by another. But this time, the entire Beleaguer family has disappeared. The Dominion took this as Amelia's punishment for her reign's imbalance. On the other side, some took it as if she and her entire family has ascended as a reward for her generosity. But the rest, see this as a threat to the purity of the Mandalas. As if a certain someone might have to do with a certain something with the incident. What is your opinion regarding the matter?
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: I believe... Amelia...
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: Amelia sure did ascended to the King's heaven as we've seen on the event of the recurrence. But we are unsure to what happen to her family it might have been just a coincidence.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: With a empasis on 'might'. There were reports of a fight in the Beleaguer mansion. The whole incident happening right in the moment of crowning the new Ice Queen is being taken as more than just a coincidence.
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: I have been selected days before the incident occured and everyone knows that! The masses is not the only one who lost someone they love in that incident! Amelia is like a mother to me. And Dje-
        <br><span class="cts-lance"></span>: Kianna.
        <br><span class="cts-kianna"></span>: Sorry. It was a very bad day for us all. but-
        <br><span class="cts-lance"></span>: But we can't let out emotions cloud our judgment. Kianna have Amelia's blessings, she selected her herself.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: The people want an answer. And that's why I'm here for.
        <br><span class="cts-lance"></span>: Then we're done. You had your answer. And the answer is that what happen is just the King's way with things. A coincidence.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Are you really going to pretend to be blind to everything?
        <br><span class="cts-lance"></span>: For a reporter you seem to be incredibly biased.
        <br><span class="cts-dian"></span>: Maybe, it's because I-
