        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>Creepy weird eyes</b>
        <br>Anyone saw that girl with the weird green eye? I need her for our project and she has the tendency of disappearing from our line of sight. Anybody knows where she lives? Or any contact, maybe?

        Don't waste you're time. You're probably talking about @thelegendarylongcat. She don't like people and nobody likes her. You guys are better of without her.

        Well that's sad. She had quite a few good ideas.

        Funny joke, man. She never had a good idea. Always the crazy thing about walls.

        You're being rude. I'd appreciate it if you can at least tell me something about finding.
