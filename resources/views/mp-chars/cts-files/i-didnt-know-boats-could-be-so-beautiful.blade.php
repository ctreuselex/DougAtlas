        <br>Eagle.
        <br>I can't believe what happened to me today.
        <br>Don't freak out tho 'coz I can already hear you freaking out from here.
        <br>
        <br>Well. I think I just met the most beautiful girl in the world! Her name is Jeanne and we talked and had an actual conversation which totally did not last for only 3 minutes like the last time I talked to a girl which is not you. Like, we talked about boats, and why the sun is flat and only hovers like 5 meters above the horizon. Personally, I took these kind of conversations as something more personal than talking about my or her favorite color, favorite standing position, or preferred hairstyle. Not that I don't care about those too, but talking about something we both admire so deeply is definitely a sign of interest and more of... you know... mind. soul links... do ya think? And that's not even the best part! So there, I cracked a joke about why... you know the joke... why the ethereans are called like that... because they're ethereally damned! haha. Well since she have some sort of sense of humor, she laughed unlike you. And I tell you! SHE WAS GORGEOUS! Like, for a moment there, time suddenly stopped and the light that so softly touched her face created glitters of hope and life. And there I was staring for a good whole minute silently shouting WOAH! It didn't ended well for me though since I bumped to a wall receiving a full blown hit to the face whilst trying to comprehend the beauty of what I am witnessing but I say that it was worth it! She also ended up laughing hard to that too. And she have a funny laugh.  I think I'm in love!

        <br>Man... I wished you have been there! I'll assure you you'll end up becoming a lesbian. Which isn't a bad thing at all. I mean, you're all boyish and physically abusive already anyway.
        <br>
        <br>PS. Do not reply to this message.
