        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>Guarding things is kinda dumb</b>
        <br>Well. As the title says; guarding things is SUUUPPPPEEERRRR boring. I get that the psychopath gets to wreck stuff, and the dreamer gets to lead stuff but me? the girl with thick emotional attachments and long term commitment success gets to guard stuff? why? I can wreck or lead to stuff you know! but well, what do I know, I'm just the one who gets to lurk into stuff and get everyone the info we need to know about stuff.
        <br>And the point of this post is well, is anyone interested in getting smacked by a log? I need to vent onto <strike>something</strike> someoone. I'm acquiring volunteers! just message me. thanks!
