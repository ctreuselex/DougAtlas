        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>Guarding things is kinda dumb</b>
        <br>Okay. I just want to get this out of my system. I get that she gets to be a leader seeing that see too friggin' ambitious. I mean that pretty much what got us into this mess. AMBITIONS! AND WILD SUPER WILD DREAMS! and also conspiracies. I'm not getting into specifics because I might get in trouble and we don't really need that right now.
        <br>So... the guy who is a maniac and likes to destroy things gets to do all the dirty work. I mean that's fine. But not really seeing as he gets to destroy things! ALL OF IT! because he's damn aggressive! and me? I get to guard stop. because why? because I get too attached too things they say. I say what? I really REALLY want to slap the two of them right now! but I won't because they're my friends BUT SERIOUSLY! I'm mad! MAD I TELL YOU! And I need to vent onto something!
        <br>And the point, well, is anyone interested in getting smacked by a log? I'm acquiring volunteers! just message me. thanks!
