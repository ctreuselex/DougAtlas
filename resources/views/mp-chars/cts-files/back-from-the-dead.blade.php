        <br>I have been notified about your retrieval.
        <br>
        <br>There have been rumors that your new position as the Head of Geios has gotten into you, and the stress that came with the responsibility might have broke you into running away. I may not know the real reason why you disappeared, but I am certain that this is not the case. I know you are better than that. 
        <br>
        <br>Though, almost as if, for a moment there, I thought that you are going to simply disappear like our mutual friend. I am glad that you are not dead.
        <br>
        <br>Anyway, I am hoping to see you back once you're well.
        <br> 
        <br>Rustom.
