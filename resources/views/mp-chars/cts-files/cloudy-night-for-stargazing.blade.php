        MISSION REPORT by <span class="cts-mig"></span>
        <br>TO: <span class="cts-thomas"></span>
        <br>TIME: 1686, SR 48th Summer
        <br>
        <br>Thomas,
        <br>It wasn't an attack.
        <br>It was simply a fight among peers.
        <br>
        <br>Three women involved were seen but not identified.
        <br> > The first one has a red and gold outfit, has two scorpion-like ponytails, and uses two crossbows as weapons. How she operates that seem to be out of my thinking capabilities.
        <br> > The second one is incredibly tall, has a glowing tattoo of (fangs?) on her left cheek, and uses a bow which she can transform into some kind of blade - which I find impressive. And reminds me of Gene. ohh Gene...
        <br> > The third one is hooded and doesn't really participate in the fight that much. Though maybe, it's just because she keeps on disappearing and I can't keep track on what she's doing. One she's chasing me, then she's stabbing my partner Colin, then she kicked the first woman in the face, then she's chasing me again. Like, dude... I'm not emotionally stable to be dealling with you right now.
        <br>
        <br>Anyway, they didn't do that much damage, aside from Colin's ruptured shoulder and their brittle bonds of friendship. I'll probably be heading back home now. Back to my crippling depression that will never go away.
        <br>I miss you Gene.
        <br>Sol please come back.
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>Mig out.

        <br>Thanks Mig.
        <br>By the way, do you want to come drink with me?
        <br>It's been a while since we talked and being alone all the time isn't doing well for you. We can talk about our wives breaking our hearts and how our sons running away and suddenly deciding to live on their own completely forgeting about their old men.
        <br>Georgie and Zaldy's coming too.

        <br>Sure. Thanks Thomas! As long as it's on you. And can we get spicy noodles?
