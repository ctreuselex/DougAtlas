        PSYINTERVIEW RECORD NO. 2
        <br>INTERVIEWER: <span class="cts-george"></span>
        <br>INTERVIEWEE: Seline Nieve Cirrus Loquintez AGE: 18
        <br>TIME: 1686, SR 10th Fall
        <br>ATTACHMENT: 1686GH:PsyInterview2:SelineNieveCirrusLoquintez.avi
        <br>
        <br>Seline Nieve Cirrus Loquintez or just Seline, daughter of #NAMEREMOVED and Sylvia Loquintez (divorced), and older sister of Llaxine Shia Henrich Loquintez.
        <br>
        <br>Aside from being in possession of one of the longest names I have ever written, Seline also have an immense sense of appreciation and incredible patience ranging from being angry that the coffee - our coffee, which we love - tastes like "water that has been idle in the sun for too long whilst a peasant's sweat is effortlessly being stirred into it with filthy mud filled fingers" to being violent that she is being interviewed second to "a worthless and primal low life from deep beneath the ground of civilization". In fact, she became too violent that we had to just let her be the first one. Don't worry tho, Jerand Montes, the first interviewee is safe, while only sustaining minor scratches and slightly deep emotional trauma.
        <br>
        <br>Back to Seline, she really is a capable fighter with amazing talent and combat effectiveness which all goes directly into her opponents greatest weaknesses in a single swift hit. The only visible problems I have with her is that there might be a possibility of her being a psychopath and that the seductive way of her demeanor which lead me to her also apparent sadism is kind of concerning.
        <br>
        <br>CONCLUSION: She hates people, she likes being high on top of the social status, and she's capable of handling herself. We better hire her before she starts a revolution, boycotting us, and remove us out of reality.
