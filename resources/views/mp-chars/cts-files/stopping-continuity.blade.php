        CT Message Tread: <span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> to <span class="cts-djerick"></span>
        <br>TIME: 1687, SR 32nd Summer
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Myst is the energy that surrounds Mirrorplane. It is the energy that created it, molded it, and continues to act as its medium for the people to use whenever they want to change anything from the city. Should Myst be manipulated is a question we ask ourselves every night whether it's right or wrong. Shall change be forever be our goal? Does anything really changes if we keep on changing the city to whatever we want it to be?
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Myst can be channeled by anyone, and even if only a selected few has the ability to actually bend the reality of Mirrorplane, if the right ability falls onto the wrong hands. Are we to blame? As there is no where to run. For we are stuck here on Mirrorplane.
        <br><span class="cts-djerick"></span>: uh... wat?
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Do you think there is more to the world than just Mirrorplane? Do you think we shall continue on changing things we shouldn't? We keep asking ourselves if we can even if the right question is if we should.
        <br><span class="cts-djerick"></span>: well, i haven't even fully appreciated the entirety of the higher ring, seeing as i lived my whole life up on nimbocolumbus. i think more to mirrorplane would be too much. and fuck myst.
        <br><span class="cts-djerick"></span>: also, CONSPIRACIES!!!
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Are you that new guy from dad's class? You sound just like him.
        <br><span class="cts-djerick"></span>: dad?
        <br><span class="cts-djerick"></span>: you mean thomas dick? also why are you sending me messages if you don't even know me? ALSO! how can my writing sound lik anything?
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Hey, it's DIRK. And yes, he's my dad. Also, I thought you where that girl from the world theory group I attended to. I think I sent this to the wrong Beleaguer.
        <br><span class="cts-djerick"></span>: ha. deullie? she's my sis. she likes conspiracies as much I do. she also has this thing for baking which i hate cos i'm not much of a fan of bread. and we do have similar initials
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Yeah, but it's not for you. So please disregard this message tread.
