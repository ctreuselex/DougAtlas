        Most likely, it has something to do with Max. I saw him dragging some bunch of stuff yesterday.

        We were having a party last night. And then the blackout happened and suddenly everybody's gone to the rapture. I mean, like, all their pretty face has been messed up and like their hair were rising like they're buzzed. I remained perfectly beautiful of course. We should really report this to the authorities. It was like soooo embarrassing. ugh. Now I can't see anyone who attended that party. ever. because I already saw how ugly they are! &lt;/3 like ew disgusting poor people. Why do people pretend all the time? like they even have a chance. :(((

        I saw Sir Dirk. he high-fived Max then gave him a crollux bar (I'm totally not jealous because crollux is my fav delish choco). But I think you went to the wrong authority. haha. Should have at least went to someone who is not in favor of student favoritism.
