        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>MRT [REPORT] MISSING TAUROSCENE'S STARSHOOTER!</b>
        <br>Starshooter, a famed weapon created by Jupiter Skyforge, the original owner of the Tauroscene Corp, has been stolen only a few hours earlier.
        <br>The Tauroscene Corp, annually helds a weapon exhibit every 28th of Spring, which showcases their incredible workmanship and creativeness that goes into every weapon they make. It has always been successful and praised by reviewers all over Mirrorplane, until now, a few hours into the exhibition, the famed Starshooter created by Jupiter Skyforge himself, has been stolen. Psykeepers has been tracking down the culprit but has yet to come with a lead regarding the crime.
        <br>The exhibition has been shut down and nobody has been let in or out the Tauroscene building. Nobody it yet certain when or whether the exhibit is going to open back. But knowing the Skyforge, the investigation will most likely continue until Starshooter is found.
