        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>[REPORT] GHOSTS! BE AWARE!</b>
        <br>Hello Everybody,
        <br>I just want to make everyone aware of these two ghosts who has been haunting our neighborhood for the past week.
        <br>THIS IS SERIOUS! There are two ghost girls - I think they're around 12 - who have been scaring people and robbing their houses clean. There has been reports of several deaths, robbery, and littering. 
        <br>Should you notice a little girl vanishing into thin air or another passing through walls. Proceed to go inside your home and cry to the King that they'll never touch you because you'll be dead!

        This is a hoax. Nobody can just disappear into thin air or pass through walls! Complete bullshit!

        Yep, and if it's true, how would a 10 year old little girl scare you death?

        By stabbing you at least four times! I've seen them they're real!

        For real guys! They tend to leave arrows on the chests of their victims. If they rob you, you better hope it's only robbing.

        Leaving arrows on people's chests is called 'stabbing' or 'shooting arrows', and people who are 'alive' are more likely to do that.

        But can people who are 'alive' disappear into thin air or pass through walls? Why are you doubting ghosts' ability to shoot living people? huh?

        Yes, that's called 'tricks'. These kids are playing you! And no, I'm pretty sure ghosts don't have archery lessons in their realm.

        Well, if they come to you, just know that I warned you!

        I'm disappointed in all of you.
