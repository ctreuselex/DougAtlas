        <br>Testing...
        <br>Dont fail me now mic.
        <br>
        <br>Alright.
        <br>Kianna, my time is running out. The air is getting heavy and the burden... I don't think I can carry it anymore.
        <br>I just want you to know that you're going to be the next Ice Queen, I don't want to bring you too deep into this, but you're the only one I believe who can go on with this without being a complete tool to them.
        <br>
        <br>Going on...
        <br>The Ice Queen is nothing but a title and I want you to be ready what this title is going to put on your shoulders. Nothing. It's not about responsibilities, not about serving the people. It's about secrets. Secrets that not even me is aware about. I feel like there are eyes and ears on the walls on this forsaken place. And that at any moment, Golwerd is going to come out of the door and zip my mouth shut. 
        <br>
        <br>I'm scared. And I know it's hypocritical of me to say this but you need to be strong. If I can stop this now, I would, but it's too late for me. All I can do now is play along and wait for the end.
        <br>
        <br>For you, maybe stepping in, aware of what's going to happen, you can do more about this curse that is being passed on for decades. On Winter, 1695, I'll be selecting you for the crowning of the next Ice Queen, then I only have several days. On the recurrence, I'll be taken from my rest, from my family for my 'ascending'. By this time, you wouldn't be able to contact me anymore.
        <br>I'm cou-
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>What are you doing?
        <br>
        <br>Leaving a message for my son. He's been really worked up on his duties. I just want to be with my family this comming recurrence.
        <br>
        <br>I'm not deaf, Amelia. And just to remind you. I know you're up to something.
        <br>
        <br>You don't know anything. You would have stopped me by now.
        <br>
        <br>You have been sending messages. Do you really think they reach where they need to go? 
        <br>You're just like Karissa, you never listen to your adviser. How can you know you'd never have control?
        <br>You can cry on your card all you want. But we'll always be the one listening to it. Not Kianna, not your kids, not Markus. Me. So maybe, it's time to sto-
