        <br>Hey Eagle.
        <br>After a while of not talking and barely seeing. Ferry came to me and said that in the time we were together, there is a miracle that happened to both of us. And actually there are two...
        <br>
        <br>One, that we both met each other and became part of each other's lives making us who we are now with memories and ideas that will forever remain in our hearts and minds.
        <br>
        <br>And two: that we have a kid... a girl.
        <br>
        <br>Ferry handed her to me. And I say that that first touch, seeing that smile with that cracking soft giggle, reminded me of someone I knew back when I was nothing but filth roaming the streets. I felt like meeting her once again. As I gently stroked the little hair she have on her head, I slowly embraced her close to my chest, to my heart, while looking towards were Ferry once stood before she faded into the light. I don't know when we will meet again, but I did more than appreciate what she left for me. She gave me a life worth living.
        <br>
        <br>Now that I'm a dad, with a growing reserve for great puns and super funny jokes, I'll do my best not to- I'll do my best.
        <br>
        <br>Also,
        <br>I went to see Mig. I just thought that maybe, now that we have something in common - being dads - we can get back together. Have a chat. Maybe ask a little advice. 
        <br>
        <br>But then I looked at him through the window of our old house, with his pals, reminicing their primes, I saw him smiling again. I said again, cos you probably known that I've been checking on him from time to time and anyway...
        <br>
        <br>I wanted to wave. At least say hi.
        <br>
        <br>But I think it would be better for the both us if I just stay away.
        <br>
        <br>I don't want him blaming himself for what happened. I don't want to blame myself for what happened.
        <br>
        <br>It was a long time ago. I just hoped we've moved on. 
        <br>
        <br>PS. Do not reply to this message.
