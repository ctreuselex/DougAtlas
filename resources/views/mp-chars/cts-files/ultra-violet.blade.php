        <br>Dear Madam Sylvia Loquintez,
        <br>It's only been a few days, but I think it's time for you to know that your daughter, Seline, is having a really hard time dealing with people. Not only that she likes to be alone, she also seems to hate everyone she is enclosed in a room with - she let us know that every time by yelling 'MUD CRAWLERS!' accompanied with finger pointing and running whispering 'die die die' into each student's ear, one by one. Not that it's a problem on it's own, but the fact that she always channels that hate into hurting other students too, especially those who are closest to her - not 'emotionally close' but those who are physically close, like a-hundred-meters-away close.
        <br>
        <br>Before we send her to someone who can help her with this problem. This letter is sent to let you know about it. And the thing is, is that we are going through with this plan with or without your approval, for we have contacted previous schools she has attended to - like 39 schools - and they all said that they have had the same problem with your daughter, that, and the fact that we are genuinely concerned. So we assumed that you just MIGHT be a little horrible parent in general. And if you try to forbid us of ensuing this course of action, the social workers will gladly remove Seline from your custody. 
        <br>
        <br>Those schools, also advised us to try distance ourselves from you. Because you're a huge 'bitch'.
        <br>Thank you. 
        <br>
        <br>Concerned Instructor,
        <br>Elliot Ebrahim

        <br>Dear Idiot Ebrahim,
        <br>Thanks for letting me know that you're a pussy. A HUGE PUSSY. And that you and your school can not handle a child as talented, pretty, and intelligent such as my own.
        <br>I'll have her removed from your school as soon as today. Because I'm already here. I'm literally typing this in front of your office.
        <br>
        <br>Love,
        <br>Sylvia Loquintez
