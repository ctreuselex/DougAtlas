        <br>Hey, Avery.
        <br>I had you assigned on a solo mission, a mission for you alone. Well, slightly solo mission.
        <br>
        <br>This is a mission exclusively for you and not for your entire team, but not really exclusive for you since you would be joined by team BOOTES or, as they call themselves now, MOON - which is a really stupid name. At least half of them only. Well, there's really no half of them since we are teams of threes, so two of them.
        <br>This is due to one of their members, Rustom Kepler, not being available for the current mission they have at hand, and since it's supposed to be here at Aeros, I thought that maybe you could give this a shot, a trial perhaps. It could be your calling. You have a lot of potential and it's time to make use of those potential instead of being stagnant on a bench, looking that ladies' backsides for hours.
        <br>
        <br>You should contact them as soon as you receive this message. They're currently down at the Middle Ring so you should probably pack your things first before contacting them. Or... You could be packing while contacting them, whatever floats your paper boats.

        <br>I like that you wasted your time writing a bunch of paragraphs you could have said with one.
        <br>
        <br>Girls...

        <br>Call me a girl one more time and I'll have you beheaded. Not only with one head. But also the other. The one below. Top and Bottom.
