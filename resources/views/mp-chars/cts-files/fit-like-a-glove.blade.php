        CT Audio Message Session: <span class="cts-kash"></span>, <span class="cts-avery"></span>, <span class="cts-mikael"></span>, <span class="cts-duellie"></span>, <span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> 
        <br>TIME: 1688, SR 8th Fall
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Alright guys.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Picking up from last time.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: The group were exploring a series of tunnels in which you had to decide between going through the right one; with the bugs, or the the left one; with the raging river. You guys chose to go through the right and encountered a giant, talking spider named Kalagorog who offered a bunch of stuff to stop you from killing his bretheren.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: ... and I courted him but he refused.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: It was very rude. I gave him like eleven flowers and stuff.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I thought your character had his arms amputated from the bite of the poisoned-fanged-fungus?
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: I was the one courting and Duellie's the one who handed flowers. I 'member.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> I don't remember anything that happened last time. And we have a tes-
        <br><span class="cts-duellie"></span> You died V.
        <br><span class="cts-duellie"></span> Eaten by a laser-rocket-raptor.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> Such good way to die.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> And that means I don't have to be here any-
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: You we're ressurected by Mike by the power of friendship.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> Dammit.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Sorry. I can stab you again if you want?
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> Alright, go ahead.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Roll the dice!
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I got 2.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Your sword broke in half as you try to lunge it through Vriskvin's armor. But the handle remained intact so you can still use it to forge another but the frost-enchanted blade is totally lost.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> Nice luck.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Wouldn't my strength contribute something to that?
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: You poured your stat into wisdom, you should have known.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: V, roll!
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span> 18.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: From the frost-enchanted blade, your armor emitted a frost nova and repelled the insects that are surrounding the whole team, increasing the visibility around the tunnel.
        <br><span class="cts-duellie"></span> Way to go!
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: I can see the light, now.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Aren't you also blinded because of the spit of the blinding-wind-drifter we found on the house of Krotack?
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: My mind is linked to Due-
        <br>
        <br>[USER: <span class="cts-ceniza"></span> joined the session] 
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Eiiii...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Can I join?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: My character is a warlock who can control the weather and is invulnerable to all types of damage and can totally break anything that is labeled divine.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: ... okay ...
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: But you have pollen allergies.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: But why???
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Oh. I throw my rejected flowers at Ceniza.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: You don't have hands.
        <br><span class="cts-duellie"></span> I'll do it.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Duellie why???
        <br><span class="cts-duellie"></span> I rolled 14.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: You missed, but the bouquet landed on Kalagorog who got angry and ate Ceniza and ran away.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Why must fate torture me???
