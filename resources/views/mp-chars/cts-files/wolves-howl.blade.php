        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: 2nd time huh. 
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I don't believe I got the privilege of meeting you for the first time around here. 
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: No.         
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: I got Vance first time I was here.    
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: You. A better replacement.  
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Why thanks.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Want me to break you out for that?
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Don't need.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: I can easilly break your spine if you try stopping me.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Impressive.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Can never do that to Vance tho.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: I've nothing but respect for 'im.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: When was the last time you two met?
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Ain't it says in the record?
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Thought this place's organized.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Says: 1685.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Long time ago...
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: That's a long time avoiding tryna to catch me ain't it.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Sure. Doesn't seem a lot like Vance to avoid catching you. Why would he do that?
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: ...        
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Because I can do things nobody in here would dare do.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Sounds like a threat.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: An empty threat.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Oh please.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Tryn' not to scare you off on your first cycle, Mr Mikey.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Rather have you as a friend I can respect. Like Vance.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Wouldn't you like that?
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I'd rather that not be friends with criminals, Trev.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Specially ones with your capabilities. As you say... "No one would dare do"
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: You've seen it did ya?
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: I smell fear, Mr Mikey.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: Your team wouldn't be behind that fake wall if you know you can handle me.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I'd love seeing you in action. But as much as I want to know how hard you can bite with a sword through your throat. I need you here for information.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: You wouldn't get anything unless you fight me, Mr Mikey.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Maybe not today.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: But I can always come back tomorrow.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Maybe then, you'll be less bloodthristy once you get a chomp on that sweet delicious steak they serve in the prison cafeteria for every 5th day of the season.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: I wouldn't miss it.
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-trevor"></span>: I'd still want to fight you tho.
