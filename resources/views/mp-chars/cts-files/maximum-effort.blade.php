        PSYINTERVIEW RECORD NO. 183
        <br>INTERVIEWER: <span class="cts-thomas"></span>
        <br>INTERVIEWEE: Maximus Seidlitz AGE: 13
        <br>TIME: 1686, SR 14th Fall
        <br>ATTACHMENT: 1686TD:PsyInterview183:MaximusSeidlitz.avi
        <br>
        <br>Maximus Seidlitz, son of Landar(deceased) and Sandra Seidlitz.
        <br>Max is a very talented young man I found in the slums of the lower circle of Geios. He lives up by the wall with his mother, and with her, has successfully built stuff that only we could have dreamed of. At an early age, Max became a part of his mother's quest to continue his father's legacy; to change the future of the city. And here he is proving that hard work can get you from the bottom to the top with a little help from family and talent. He may be too young but I am already close to two hundred applicants and I can say that he is the best of the bunch.
        <br>
        <br>Max also performed well in our combat practical tests, excelling in fist to fist fights, and his Myst Manipulation made use of raw Myst, crystallization, and what seems to be some form of Sigilios - only less sigil-ly, in a way. I can see it in his eyes that he is eager to get into the Institute and show the city what he and his family created. From Automatic Crystal Myst Armaments to Myst Generators to bath soaps that is guaranteed not to slip from your hand, I can't even see the limit to what more he has to offer us.
        <br>
        <br>CONCLUSION: I really like this guy. Seriously, hire him now.

        <br>This seem to be super biased, not one single bad point? Are you sure he didn't bribed you for this?
        <br>Automatic Crystal Myst Armaments sounds like a real death treat to who ever it is pointed to.

        <br>Well, he did said that I'll get one of those ACMA guns. Which is too much of a sweet deal! And yes it's actually a super cool looking gun!
        <br>Also, a bad point? Fine. I'll deduct one point from his total score because he's too awesome to be true. Have I mentioned it's because he can make guns?
        <br>
        <br>PS. Oh man! I didn't included the word 'gun' in his report! Georgie, remind me to revise this sometime later!
