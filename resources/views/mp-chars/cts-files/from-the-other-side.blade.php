        <br>Hey Max,
        <br>I see you already heard of this.
        <br>You've been appointed a new teammate. Yup, there's only one. He's name is Daud Irwin, he came from the Institute's Geios Division and is pretty much a lot like you. From what I know about him, he was raised from the lower rings, a gifted student -he won the cup for Geios last recurssion, a pretty chill dude overall, and if you've been skipping, he's from GEIOS! We guys might have some form of tether.
        <br>
        <br>I expect you to meet him this afternoon. He still has three more recurssions in the Institute. So I look forward to seeing you to be like a mentor to him. Being mentored by another gifted student almost graduating eh! What could go wrong?
        <br>That's if, of course, you're really ready to go out of the shell you've been hiding in.
        <br>
        <br>It wasn't your fault you know? Sandra said you're still blaming yourself for what happen, and I'm here to tell you that, you know, things happen. Just make good of what you accomplished despite the failures that came with it.
        <br>
        <br>Learn from it. The Institute needs you.

        <br>So I've met him. Actually, he seemed familiar.
        <br>Yes he's a pretty chill dude. With a nice dose of hatred towards my cats.
        <br>
        <br>We will not get along well. Geios or not.

        <br>Well... He's allergic.
        <br>
        <br>I talked to him as well. He said you're kind of a bully.
        <br>Maybe you two just needs more time. You'll be fine.
        <br>
        <br>Also, you must have seen a lot of pictures of him. He's quite the celebrity.

        <br>You have been my supervisor since 1686. I'm surprised this is the first time someone told you that I'm kind of a bully. Everybody says that! I don't even know why. I mean, all I said was that if he had more hair on his head, he'd need less time to adapt to a more fur-filled environment.

        <br>Okay. You're a bully. Thanks for letting an almost-bald man who has been your supervisor since 1686 know that.
