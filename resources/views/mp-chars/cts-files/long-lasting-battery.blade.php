        EXPERIMENT AUDIO LOG: MystCore Battery #84
        <br>USER: <span class="cts-landar"></span>

        <br>
        <br>Hey guys, Landar here, this is test No. 84.
        <br>I made adjustments on the inner shell just right outside the main core to prevent overheating and smudging of those delicate sigil-like wirings, also some sort of vent to allow the cooling system to work much better, especially if it is going to be attached to something mobile... something like... an armor... maybe?
        <br>Attachments are also easier now since Sandra introduced me to these belts. They are at least seven times better than duct tape.
        <br>
        <br>How's it going Landar? Any good progress? Max is here to watch.
        <br>
        <br>Everything's good Sandra. Also... hello there you chubby little thing.
        <br>
        <br>What are you doing papa?
        <br>
        <br>Daddy's having a breakthrough. A BIG BREAKTHROUGH.
        <br>You won't believe it, but this thing. It can change the city! 
        <br>
        <br>Oh come on now. You got to think big, hun!
        <br>This thing may even change the future!
        <br>
        <br>Right Sandra! Haha! You know that I wouldn't have done this without you darling.
        <br>
        <br>[kisses]
        <br>
        <br>ew... I'm confused papa.
        <br>
        <br>Hehe. Someday you'll understand kiddo. But for now. Let's boot it up.

        <br>Uhm... What's that?
        <br>
        <br>It's nothing. I just need to see it light up.

        <br>Max, get upstairs. Landar, stop it now!
        <br>
        <br>It's powering up!
