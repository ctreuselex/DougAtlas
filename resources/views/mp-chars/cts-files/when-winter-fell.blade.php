        <br>Hey Jay or Moon - I heard you go by that name now,
        I haven't written to you in a while. I've been really busy... you know... waving my hands at the city. Creating snowflakes. And you've been busy dealing with the people in the lower ring. Saving lives. I thought of visiting you at your post but they said you wouldn't have the time.
        <br>
        <br>Anyway, today I left my station and decided to visit our home for the comming recurrence which is at N, Nimbocolumbus - in case you've already forgotten where it was. It was a burst of memories from when you and your sister were still young, full of life, and full of random and baseless conspiracy theories. Your sister baked a cake and asked me to design it for her. Little did she know that I got slightly too addicted to frosting in the times of my reign as the Ice Queen. Your father was here too, he was old but still kicking. I mean, literally kicking. We played Blunt Projectile Dodging for the whole afternoon. He won 8 out of 3, but it was not a fair fight since my projectiles are made of ice and he can conjure fire out of his hands.
        <br> 
        <br>It was one of the best days of my life! I wish for the day to be longer and that you've been a part of it.
        <br>
        <br>Because you know, tomorrow's my ascending. I hope to see you, and Duellie, and Markus... all of you... together, at least for the last time... before I go. 
        <br>
        <br>And remember. I love you Jay,
        <br>Amelia, your mom - in case you forgot this too.
