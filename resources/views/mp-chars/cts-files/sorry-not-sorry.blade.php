        <br>Good Day Mr. Chance,
        <br>It is good knowing that you, Chance Linus, is an 'important fan from high society' of the Tauroscene Corp. However, your status as an 'elite from high society' does not guarantee you any weapon to be made by my company. 
        <br>You see, we only acquire applicants from the best of the best of the Institute and help them further their already impressive set of skills. And your 'skills acquired from high society' does not say anything about your real capabilities.
        <br>If only you'd come here to my office and put your talents on a show, that I, personally, would see if you are to be accepted as a bearer of a Tauroscene weapon, though, I can already predict that your 'bravery from the high society' is not what I am expecting seeing that you should have done that first, or at least, thought of it first if you really have your so called 'smarts from the high society'.
        <br>
        <br>Best of Luck, Helios Skyforge

        <br>Too bad for Mr. Skyforge, he's making a tough enemy! I see what I can do to convince him otherwise.

        <br>On the otherhand, maybe I'll ask Sandra instead.
