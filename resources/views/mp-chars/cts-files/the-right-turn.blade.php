        <br>Hello.
        <br>Demeter live on... uh... the roof of my house.
        <br>Time to record the thought of the day... which for now, I still haven't actually thought of yet. 
        <br>hmm...
        <br>This may take a whil- oh
        <br>I know!
        <br>What the hell are... those Celestial Sigils?
        <br>We know that CS - I'll call them CS from now - is a technique -
        <br>Should it really be a technique? it's more like a medium for the actual techni- well. fartface!
        <br>The technique's called Sigilios! RIGHT! ...
        <br>Well... back to the idea.... we know that CS is a medium that only the greatest of Maximos can utilize. It allows them to tap into some kind of source that basically grants them unlimited supply of Mys-
        <br>
        <br>Well... aren't you a noisy bunch?
        <br>
        <br>[gasp] ... please don't kill me.
        <br>
        <br>Quiet down and I won't... I'm not in the mood for killing today.
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>Are you an assassin?
        <br>Who's your target?
        <br>
        <br>That would be you if you dont shut. up.
        <br>
        <br>Okay. Right.
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>Well what brought you here?
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>hhmmm?
        <br>
        <br>[sign] Okay, I'm... lost.
        <br>
        <br>Is it just lost? or lost-lost?
        <br>
        <br>Lost-lost
        <br>
        <br>Feeling of drifting away?
        <br>
        <br>Yep.
        <br>
        <br>From who, I wonder?
        <br>
        <br>That would also be you if you don't stop talking.
        <br>
        <br>But... that wouldn't be the kind of drifting away we were talking about is it?
        <br>Pretty sure if that's it then you already succeed in drifting away from who ever it is on your mind.
        <br>
        <br>I really hate you. But... well... you're kinda right.
        <br>So... there's this... man... who took me in since I was little. He raised me to become who I am. He told me that what I do, no matter how little it affected the city, our people, me, it will be for the better of us. But-
        <br>Are you recording this?
        <br>
        <br>Uhhh... yeah?
        <br>
        <br>Fine go on... So...
        <br>But for cycles, he's been asking me to kill all those people. 'For the better of the future' he says. 'It will be good for us' he says.
        <br>But I am the one who releases the arrow. He only knows that the job is done but for every shot I take, I see a dead body, a friend being taken away, a family being torn apart. A person... Who could've only be doing what he thought was good for those he loved. They're just the same as me.
        <br>Do you see? I don't know if I'm still doing the right thing.
        <br>
        <br>Well... what do you think you were doing?
        <br>
        <br>Is that really how you're going to respond?
        <br>
        <br>No, I mean... you're clearly thinking that what you're doing is wrong. No matter how hard this 'man' says that it's for the good, it's against what you see is good.
        <br>
        <br>He raised me. I'm sure he knows more about what I'm doing more than me. Who knows? Maybe in the future-
        <bR>
        <br>But that's yet to happen... and...
        <br>that's it?
        <br>Did he also told you to sit on my roof and tell me these things? is something in the future going to be good because of this?
        <br>
        <br>Maybe he did.
        <br>
        <br>Who's this man you're talking about anyway?
        <br>
        <br>You're better off without knowing his name.
        <br>
        <br>... Alright... Well, can I at least have yours? I'm not really good with remembering face- AHH!
        <br>
        <br>...
        <br>
        <br>Thanks?
        <br>Thanks for catc- for grabbing me... so I won't fall. off... my... roof.
        <br>
        <br>Your roof's a little slippery. 
        <br>I'll be going.
        <br>
        <br>I never had this kind of conversation before.
        <br>Can I... uh...
        <br>
        <br>What?
        <br>
        <br>Can I at least have a hug?
        <br>
        <br>No.
        <br>
        <br>Hey! I... uh... I'm Demeter!
        <br>If you just wanna hang out or something, I'll be right here!
        <br>On this roof...
        <br>well... see ya!
        <br>Bollocks!
        <br>I really need to practice communicating with people.
