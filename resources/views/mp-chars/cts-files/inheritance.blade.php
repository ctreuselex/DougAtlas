        <br>Vriskvin,
        <br>I don't want to be the one to tell you this but I feel like I need to. Your father, Thomas Dirk, died on duty on 1693, SR 53rd Summer, while on a mission to escort a businessman, J.Mishican to the deeper parts of Lower Aeros. He, J.Mishican, and three other Psykeepers were murdered by a gang leader known as Lemaitre for reasons we have yet to know. Every accusations towards Lemaitre are left hanging still as the King said that J.Mishican should not be outside of Mirrorplane in the first place. That and the fact that Lemaitre is known to be a ruthless bigot who will just kill anyone we send to bring him to us.
        <br>
        <br>I attached your father's eyepatch here. Don't forget to materialize it. He said that it was one of his greatest treasures along with you at the top.
        <br>
        <br>I'm sorry for your loss.
        <br>
        <br>PS. The King mentioned that you should not go and seek vegeance because he wouldn't like to lose another valuable Psykeeper but I say ignore that. Do what you can and bring justice to your father's misfortune. He was my best pal. So if you need me, I'm just one call away. If I didn't answer, then you know where I went.
        <br>
        <br>Condolences and Good Luck,
        <br>George Holland
