        MISSION REPORT by <span class="cts-gene"></span>

        <br>Gene Salatiel here reporting on mission 'AEROSFIRE' for team AURIGA.
        <br>The fire that lasted for almost 2 weeks, 12 days to be exact, has finally been extinguished. Thanks to the help of the Aeros locals, a few from the nearby district from Luminos, and of course, Mr. Markus Beleaguer and his team for taking care of that giant, flaming duck or something.
        <br>
        <br>One thing though, is that Colin, despite having a meter long metal rod running through his right leg, found a child so deep within the ashes of the ruined district. To our surprise, the child is still alive with little to no injuries but maybe a few light scratches and bruises here and there. Always wanting a child of my own, I took responsibility of taking care of him and I am very delighted that Mig, mah hubby, got his impotent self attached to the child faster than he *insert sexual themes here*.
        <br>
        <br>We named the kid 'Sol' after the sun. Because... you know... we can. I guarantee, it'll make you laugh once you figured out how appropriate that is for a pun.
        <br>
        <br>My only problem is that I can't seem to find actual valid points for me and my husband to adopt a random child we found in the middle of a razed district. But we already fell in love with him and I believe he feels the same way for us too. So my husband came up with a plan to just tell the social workers that I can figure out a way if the kid can give us some sort of clues to who or what brought that fire monster into the city. He's a child maybe, but they tend to bring miracles, especially if they're only like two cycles old.
        <br>So I'll wait for that while Mig and Colin can continue on to looking for anything that can prove helpful till as intended.
        <br>
        <br>Gene out.

        <br>Well. Good luck with your new kid Gene. I already talked to the social workers so they will not give you problems with Sol and potentially loose our closest lead. Even if that lead is incredibly ridiculous. Like, a baby pointing clues? What? haha.
        <br>
        <br>PS. Also tell Mig that it is not healthy nor it is socially acceptable to feed his baby with super spicy food. And no, 'the baby seems to enjoy it' is not a valid excuse.
