        CT Message Tread: <span class="cts-avery"></span> to <span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>
        <br>TIME: 1689, SR 22nd Winter
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Hey.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Hey.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Hey.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Duellie talked to me yesterday.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Do I have business with that? Why are you talking to me?
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Well grumpy guy. She kinda want me to talk you out of your aggresive behavior.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Won't work. Rustom already talked to me. And I still punched people.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: You punched Rustom?
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: No.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: I punched Djerick for the third time.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Okay that's it.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Duellie asked me to ask you to stop punching her brother.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: I mean, Djerick is really punchable. But you gotta lay it down a bit.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Maybe punch him only twice a week? and then once a week?
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Can't.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: I have a quota.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Ohh come on... You gotta let him grow up man.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Djerick look like a little kid!
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Actually, you two should grow up! 
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Not that I'm saying you look like a kid.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: I mean, you're obviously a giant standing next to the guy.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: And that's probaly why he looks like a prepubescent kid next to you.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: So...
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Why do I get the feeling you're doing this because you're just trying to get to Duellie?
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: What? Haahaha! That's absurd!
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: I'm actually trying to get to her hotter bestfriend.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Duellie said she'll let me talk to her if I get you to not punch Djerick anymore.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Denied.
        <br><span class="cts-avery"></span>: Oh come on man!
