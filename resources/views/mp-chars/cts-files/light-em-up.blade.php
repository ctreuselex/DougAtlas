        <br>[buzzing intensifies]
        <br>
        <br>Stuff are starting to float around here Max. I don't think this is in our "stuff that are supposed to happen" list.
        <br>
        <br>[mumbling] I can't feel my limbs.
        <br>
        <br>Wait. I'm recalibrating the joints. Must have simply been stuck.

        <br>
        <br>Nothing's working!
        <br>
        <br>Well, have you tried turning it off and on again?
        <br>
        <br>We didn't integrated some sort of switch into this. 
        <br>
        <br>WHAT? like maybe... just unplug the armor.
        <br>

        <br>Cris.
        <br>
        <br>I have no idea what I was saying back there. I mean. recalibrating? haha. I'm probably just spicing up my words.
        <br>
        <br>Cristine.
        <br>
        <br>Like, I get really nervous around a camera.
