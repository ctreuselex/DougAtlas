        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>1685: The Rise of the 9th Ice Queen!</b>
        <br>Say "Congratulations!" to the the new Ice Queen of the Children of Mandalas, Amelia Beleaguer!
        <br>A powerful, good willed, and just overall incredible person, that's who Amelia is. It's nice to have someone I personally know sitting into the ever rotating throne of the Ice Queen! I am more than happy to serve you as your Snow Angel.
