        <br>TIME: 1691, SR 31st Spring
        <br>
        <br>Hey Eagle. How's Blue?
        <br>I don't know if you've heard of this guy. But, woah. This guy has time as his material affinity!
        <br>
        <br>His name is Vriskvin Dirk, and he's a Psykeeper, he graduated from the Institute only this Spring and he and his team 'MOON' - pretty dumb name - has been wrecking cases around the middle ring for the past few days. They have become pretty popular among the people, like really, REALLY popular. Though, they did said that the team has been around for a long time, actually, but it's only now that they're actual Psykeepers are they starting to make some really big difference. 
        <br>
        <br>I have some suspicions though, 
        <br>HE controls time... and the people said that HE and his team has been doing this for a looong time. You see where I'm going?
        <br>Okay so... What if? These people can time travel? What if the people who saw them back then are simply seeing them as they are now, but only back then in the past, solving crimes that couldn't be possibly solved back then?
        <br>
        <br>LIKE isn't this great?
        <br>
        <br>Maybe, they're the answer to my problem! This Vriskvin dude can be the answer to a looooooot of problems! Maybe he can find Ferry!
        <br>
        <br>I don't know if I should, but I think I need to think about this much further, and you know that thinking isn't really my great feat, so I'm kinda leaving all this to you. but. so. What do you think?
        <br>
        <br>I'll be there.
        <br>
        <br>PS. Do not reply to this message.
