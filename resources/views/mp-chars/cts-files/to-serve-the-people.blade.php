        <br>
        <br>The fire as been put down. Only the main and the surrounding three houses are affected. Two were injured with one casualty; who is indentified as Psykeeper Gene Salatiel.
        <br>
        <br>We hoped to save her, but the burns she took was far fatal for my capabilities to handle, we immediately took her to the nearest medical facility but it was too late, she has been declared dead on arrival. One of the survivors, Mig Salatiel the casualty's husband, revealed that there occured a fight between them and their son, Sol, who has been missing since.
        <br>I already contacted Psykeeper Zaldy Ruiz in hopes of tracking him down.
        <br>
        <br>Attached below is our interview with Mig Salatiel as proof.
        <br>
        <br>Serving,
        <br>Snow Angel, Kianna.
