        PSYINTERVIEW RECORD NO. 16
        <br>INTERVIEWER: <span class="cts-maximus"></span> 
        <br>INTERVIEWEE: Llaxine Shia Henrich Loquintez AGE: 16
        <br>TIME: 1693, SR 10th Fall
        <br>ATTACHMENT: 1693MS:PsyInterview16:LlaxineShiaHenrichLoquintez.avi
        <br>
        <br>Llaxine Shia Henrich Loquintez, daugther of Elliot Ebrahim and Sylvia Loquintez.
        <br>Llaxine is a very talented Mystic. Affiliated to one of the more uncommon medium, which is light and is knowlegable of Sigilios which is a REALLY hard practice, Llaxine was able to make use of such her talents blind and disorient her opponents taking their idle time to pursue advantage against them. She also reminds me of myself, not boasting but, as you can clearly see, she is being interviewed here at such a young age like me! I can clearly see that there's something that's pushing her to become better and greater than ever. And with her humbleness and day-brightening smile, it is obvious that this girl will go a long way. And have I mentioned her smile, really gorgeous!
        <br>
        <br>Llaxine also found a way to make herself hover above the ground, and if you find that unimpressive due to me already hovering above the ground, let me tell you that she is not stuck inside an armor, unlike yours truly. Also, she can become invisible at times. Which might be a good or a bad thing.
        <br>
        <br>CONCLUSION: She's jolly, pretty, and very talented. Let's hire her.
