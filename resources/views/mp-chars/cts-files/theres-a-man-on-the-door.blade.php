        CT Audio Message Session: <span class="cts-mikael"></span>, <span class="cts-theodore"></span> 
        <br>TIME: 1696, SR 4th Spring
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Ok.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Kash just told me.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: There's literally a man on your door.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: A dead man.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: In front of your office door.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Care to explain?
        <br>

        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: This feels like somebody is trying to scare us.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I feel more disgusted, honestly.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: It's like throwing trash in front of your house.
        <br>
        <br>[USER: <span class="cts-kash"></span> joined the session] 
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Kash, any news?
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: The body is yet to be identified.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: It seems to be rotten already. Like it's been dugged up from cycles ago of being underground.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Also seems to be a message from the Dark Crusade.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Especially with the: "We know what you did"
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: And the: "We know what you're hiding"
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: People still take them seriously?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Whoever they killed today, or some other day, is not even a known member of any relevant party.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: They're wasting our time.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: But they did took up the time to dig a corpse from the underground, so they must have some strong connections to have carried a body from the underground to Theo's office without getting noticed.

        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: It could be a decoy.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: For what? I don't think these derk crusadurs are intelligent enough to plan anything. Let alone set up a decoy.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: It's a pretty good decoy if it really was though.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Makes me feel really bad about the body they just dug up.
        <br><span class="cts-vriskvin"></span>: Another news in...

        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: The body is Markus Beleaguer's.
        <br><span class="cts-berex"></span>: The body is Markus Beleaguer's.
        <br><span class="cts-berex"></span>: You just ruined my entrance.
        <br><span class="cts-kash"></span>: Sorry.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Oh my...

        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: You better not.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: What? Why?
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: Let me an-
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: You're not stopping us Theo, I'm coming over.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: Fi- Fine!
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: We're going to help. Not to make anything worse, so don't wor-

        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: There's an attack!
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: Decoy it is.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: I'm quite impressed.
        <br><span class="cts-mikael"></span>: I don't know what's happening. And I'm totally not panicking right now.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Just don't do-
