        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Theo...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Theo?...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Are you not going to answer?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Because that's quite stupid knowing that you already took the time raising a finger and opening up your card.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: [distant male voice] Noxa?
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: [distant male voice] Who's calling?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Oh hey Noxa!
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Can you bring me to your master please.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: What do you need Ceniza?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Good girl...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: I'm just checking in.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: You've been acting really weird lately.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: You didn't even attended Vriskvin's official coming back to service celebration.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: He's been through a lot in the past cycles.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: He'd appreciate it if a fellow colleague such as yourself were there.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: I was sick. Headache.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: And I have been dealing with a bunch of thieves lately. Busy.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Oh. I hope you're okay now.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Is there anything we can do to help?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Thieves are like... the lowliest of things to worry about as Heads of Division. And you having problem with them seems to be very unlike you.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: Leave me alone, Ceniza.
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Hey. I'm just trying to help.
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Did you just threw your card?
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Wha... 
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Theo!
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Fine...
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Noxa?
        <br><span class="cts-theodore"></span>: [woof]
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Noxa!
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Click the button, girl!
        <br><span class="cts-ceniza"></span>: Cl-
