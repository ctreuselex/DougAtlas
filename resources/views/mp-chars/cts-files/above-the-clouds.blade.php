        MISSION REPORT by <span class="cts-berex"></span>
        <br>TO:<span class="cts-theodore"></span>
        <br>TIME: 1698, SR 58th Winter
        <br>
        <br>Berex reporting for team STORM regarding mission 'MISTCLOUD'.
        <br>The mysterious cloud that has covered the middle Mystos despite the lack of activity of the Ice Queen in the said area has been pointed to Royd Calixto. He, the  leader, and his gang of seven other men, one of which has escaped, were in the process of robbing a Myst Armament Manufacturing Facility of the Landar Industries, property of Sandra Seidlitz, taking equipments such as guns and other weapons. They said that the deal is sold for an underground movement called 'The Dark Crusade' whose actions has been growing more and more violent every recurssions.
        <br>
        <br>One of our members; Seline, is said to be acquainted with Royd Calixto, and her reaction in meeting the man; a quick and abrupt death by a glaive to the chest, proved it and caused the man's demise. Seline said she apologizes for her lack of professionalism and asks for a leave for a time to clear her mind.
        <br>
        <br>With my concern, I contacted Madam Sylvia Loquintez, Seline's mother, and figured out, after an hour of ravage insults and mockery, that Royd Calixto is Seline's abusive father. After digging for more info, Royd is in deed, abusive, and abuse has been added to the list of charges he is now facing. Not that those would matter anymore, due to the fact that he is now dead. But with who Seline was back at the Institute, I think she gave him a safe exit from the much more frightening chapter that would have been the next one for his life.

        <br>Berex Fritzie out.
