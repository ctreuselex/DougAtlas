        <br>Greeting Mrs. Loquintez,
        <br>I am Telik Obek, owner of Obek's Dancing School, which your daugther, Llaxine Shia Henrich Loquintez, is currently attending every second day. And I am to report a compliant regarding your daughter's behavior. Letting you know that it is not appropriate for a lady such as herself to wear or furthermore play with such dangerous accessories. Image of said accessories in attachment. I advice you to take it away from her possession before she decides that it's okay to stab herself, stab other classmates, or break precious potteries around my school. And if she have already decided, then I advice you to tell her that stabbing herself is kind of alright. That way, it'll be a positive thing for us not to worry about thinking about disposing her existence.
        <br>
        <br>I may also add, to tell your daughter to try and keep herself visible at all times, at least now that she is still alive. As much as we admire her practicing her rare talents, we do not allow practicing such talents in this school. Talents which are a complete waste of time and effort and not related to dancing or whatsoever.
        <br>
        <br>Thank you,
        <br>Telik Obek, Obek's Dancing School

        <br>Hi Telik,
        <br>This is Llaxine's father. Thanks for letting us know about this problem. We'll try to make amends to our lack of supervision regarding our daughter's behavior. It's been a difficult time, you see, I'm having a hard time finding a job and Sylvia, has been... well... busy being herself. I'll try to make time for the benefit of my daughter. By time, you shall expect her to be more poised, visible, and less into sharp objects.
        <br>Thanks.
