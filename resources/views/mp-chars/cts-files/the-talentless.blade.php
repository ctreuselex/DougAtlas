        PSYINTERVIEW RECORD NO. 52
        <br>INTERVIEWER: <span class="cts-thomas"></span>
        <br>INTERVIEWEE: Djerick Beleaguer AGE: 18
        <br>TIME: 1686, SR 11th Fall
        <br>ATTACHMENT: 1686TD:PsyInterview52:DjerickBeleaguer.avi
        <br>
        <br>Djerick Beleaguer, son of Markus and Amelia Beleaguer, younger brother of Deullie Beleaguer.
        <br>
        <br>The Beleaguer family is known for having incredible talents, with Markus once being the head of the Mystos Division of the Institute to Amelia being our current Ice Queen. But Djerick. Djerick falls short in that regard and in regards of actual height. He haven't learned any form of Myst Manipulation, no knowledge of his material affiliation, and seems to have very low understanding of how our city works. He doesn't even know what Myst is despite my numerous attempts of giving him clues without making him and myself look like idiots in front of the other interviewers.
        <br>
        <br>He, however, is a very creative combatant - despite the height - and has shown to be capable of taking down multiple people at once with nothing but a stick and lots of impressive breakdancing abilities, which is something I admire since I can't even properly swing a stick without hitting myself. He crafted this stick of his - Yes, it's not a Tauroscene - with rusty looking but incredibly sharp metal scraps, which is a very specialized pole arm for himself and calls it 'Aquadextrius', a name I'm guessing he got by putting paint on his feet and breakdanced all the way to make letters out of the random lines of paint. 
        <br>
        <br>He's also recommended by our Ice Queen, which you've guessed, is his mother. She mentioned that she felt a very powerful special talent that lies beneath Djerick's thick skin that is yet to be unleashed. Something unique. Something that we have never seen before. And something within the range of lame excuses a mother would say just so we would hire her son.
        <br>
        <br>CONCLUSION: Let's hire him, he's a pretty cool kid, mediocre Armagus - assuming that he's responsible for my water bottle randomly dropping to the floor - with extra impressive dance moves, but he did punched me once in the face and left a bluish, painful mark on my left eye - I'll wear an eye patch from now on. Because I think it's rad.

        <br>The eye patch really makes you look stupid.

        <br>I know you have some massive hard on for Zaldy. BUT... we know she hates you. And I guess she probably meant something like "You're so hot I feel good about setting you on fire cos youre already on fire in my eyes" :(
        <br>Truth hurts... I know.
