        CT Audio Message Session: <span class="cts-porlo"></span>, <span class="cts-rustom"></span>
        <br>TIME: 1694, SR 19th Summer
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Brother! I am in need of your assistance.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: To give you an idea of what situation I am currently in...
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: I am dying right now.
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: You're not dying.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: How can you be so certain. Can't you hear my coughing?
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: [coughs loudly]
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: Rainier already told me what happened. You're finer than I hoped you'd be.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: And you'd believe him more than me?
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Your own blood!
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: He took care of us since we were children.
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: Plus, he's words are far more trustworthy than yours.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Wow!
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Did you know that hurt me more than you think you did.
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: No. I'm guessing it hurt you just as much as I think it would.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Double Wow! I'm telling our parents!
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: They are dead Porlo.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Triple Wo-
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: How come I wasn't aware of this information?
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Such knowledge seem to be far important to be kept from me.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Our parents. Dead? 
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: And I was clueless? 
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: I sent you a message about what happened, five cycles ago.
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: You most likely ignored it because you were too busy making yourself important to the city.
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: And then being too busy hiding because the city ended up not liking you.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Well...
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: I do not have much time diving in to the amount of messages I have to search for it right now.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Did they leave anything before they transcended to the heavens?
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: They did left words.
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Anything for me?
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: Here it goes...
        <br><span class="cts-rustom"></span>: "We are only a little bit not so disappointed."
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Uh...
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Is it for the both of us? 
        <br><span class="cts-porlo"></span>: Cause I'm only a little bit not so disappointed in you too.
