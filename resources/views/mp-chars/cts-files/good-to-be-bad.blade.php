        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: State your name.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Melinda Mc Flurry.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: State your name.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Zedrik Azazel.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Age.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: 120.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Age...
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: 28.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: You are no fun.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Are we done?
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Seems like you guys are already getting the hand of the fact that I will not be giving away any info-
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Zedrik...
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: It's a bit rude interrupting someone's dialog... uh...
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Got any name, miss?
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: My name's Gamora Asbitos.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Surprised you didn't know me.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: I've been the head of Luminos for the at least 6 cycles now.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: What an achievement, heh?
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Better than your streak of robbing, getting caught, and escaping every few days.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: I find my achievement a bit more rewarding. Plus without the need of excessive risks. 
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Is this how you do interviews?
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Casual bragging?
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: That's a whole kind of low...
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Not really.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: I find this routine to be more effective.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: And aren't you getting tired of the same grunts from Dirk, Holland, and Vance? I thought you'd appreciate something a little bit different.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: I like it.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Will not get you results however.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Does it really matter? 
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: I mean... You've been doing this for 7.. 8.. 129 times now.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Quite the loyalty you got there.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Something... that you're quite familiar with I see.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: To what?
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: The Dominion?
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: What else? 
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: You guys at the Ark must've really be getting it.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Of course were nothing but dogs to the higher ups. What is freewill?
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: I know what you're trying to do, miss.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: I will not fall for it.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Of course you wouldn't. Your loyalty belongs to someone else.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Loyalty is not the same as mindless following. 
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: I chose to do this.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Of course.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: That's exactly what I did. Why I'm here right now. I bet they'll be giving you acknowledgements for this achievement when you get back home. 
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: They wou-
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: Th...
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Don't worry Zed. It's not about them. This is about you.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: There will be no words spoken today, miss.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: Maybe tomorrow?
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: You know I'd be gone.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: I know you'll be back.
        <br><span class="cts-zedrik"></span>: ...
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: And we you do. I'd like you to get the sense of individuality you been fighting for, Zed.
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: So... Same time, same place?
        <br><span class="cts-gamora"></span>: I'll be waiting...
