        <br>TIME: 1694, SR 23rd Summer
        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Okay... State your name. and reason for punching a kid in the face.
        <br><span class="cts-jack"></span>: What? I swear I didn't started it!
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: First of all... 'What' is not your name. And second, 'not starting it' is not a reason for punching a kid in the face.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: I see you have become quite a dad, Mr Puns.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Shut up, Daud. Let me work.
        <br><span class="cts-jack"></span>: Sir Seidlitz, I... I mean... Kruger punched this girl... and... I stepped in for her.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Do you believe she can't handle herself?
        <br><span class="cts-jack"></span>: No... I mean... she's already down and he's going to kick her.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Do you like this girl?
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: It doesn't matter if he likes her or not, Daud.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: What do you mean? It could be his motivation why he stepped in to fight.
        <br><span class="cts-jack"></span>: No. no. I don't know her. Maybe it's just compassion?
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Yeah, Daud, maybe it's just compassion.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Like you'd know what that is Max. You don't even have a problem watching them punch each other.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: I wasn't even there!
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: And you also don't have this monitor on your office that directly spots the position of their fight in the hallway!
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Hey, it's him we're interviewing here! Not me!
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Oh yes. Sorry, I forgot you'd have a lot more experience into topics like bullying than me.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: What are you trying to say?
        <br><span class="cts-jack"></span>: Sirs?
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Shut up, Jack.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: What I was tryi- Huh? I see you can't connect dots as well. So much for being a genius eh?
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: What the- You're not helping Daud.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: And if you're not going to help... It's better that you leave.

        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: And he's not here...
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: He's not here to talk us out of this anymore...
        <br>[slams door]
        <br><span class="cts-jack"></span>: ...
