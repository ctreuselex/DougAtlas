        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>IM ALIVE BITCHES!</b>
        <br>Hey Everyone! Porlo here!
        <br>And yeess I'm aliveeeeee! I know there has been rumors of me being dead and enclosed in a fridge running around the cts for days, but worry no more! Becos I'm back! And I'm totally back into action! Busting theories, cracking wise phrases, and putting common sense into people's illogical logic!
        <br>Anyway, before all those jazzzz... I probably have to tell you the story of how I escaped my near-death experience!
        <br>---
        <br>Ok. It was night. Cause all the horible things happen at night. And I was alone, walking home from a day after an amazing episode of The Great Mighty Porlo(TM). And then there was a tall, strong, hooded woman that suddenly blew the silence away from the night, she whispered "come to me!". And so I go near, and with every step, I see more of her already gorgeous face being slightly shadowed by the horrid hood she was wearing, I say "O why have you asked for me my dear?" I reached out my hand to hers to give her a glimpse of hope that she'll be taken out of the night safely. But then-
        <br>SHE FUCKING STABBED ME IN THE CHEST WITH AN ARROW!
        <br>Outraged! I swung my arm, making use of physics, to land a painful slap into her face. But I remember how beautiful she was, I stopped my arm with all the force I can exert, for I know there is still a gentleman inside me preventing me from becoming a beast!
        <br>AND THEN SHE FUCKING STABBED ME AGAIN.
        <br>From the pain, I did not cry. I jerked my head, revealing that I am strong. And that i will not bow! I slowly opened my eyes and straightly gazed into her eyes, which glittered with love for now that she know my strength. I invited her home, with all the charm I can beckon. But she refused.
        <br>AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE A STAB. BUT THAT HURTS FUCKING MORE!
        <br>I shed a single tear before my vision slowly faded to darkness as she catches me into her embrace and bring me back to her place... where we did things for dayssss.
        <br>---
        <br>Aaaand... yeah, that's what happened.

        @theGreatMightyPorlo27 There are actual pictures and videos of you being taken out of a fridge! If you took the time to see through the bullshit you just spew, then maybe. JUST MAYBE, you'd know that you're the one who needs to put common sense into your own illogical logic!
