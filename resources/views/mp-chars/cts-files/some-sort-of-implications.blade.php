        <br>
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Hey... uh... is this a bad time?
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: No... not really...
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: I actually expected you to call.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: You did?
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Well.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Since you hate me I kinda expected the worst... and that you'd be mocking me right now.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: oh.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: yeah.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: sorry.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: But I haven't mocked you yet.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: So... I'm not gonna do that.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Thanks.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Just wondering.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Cross called me and asked where you are right now.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: He told me you're really broken losing the cup to Luminos this year.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Kinda... Kinda broke your streak there buddy.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Huh.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: I'm here at sir Holland's.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: I just felt that I've disappointed him.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: He'd probably make me do 50 pushups for every eye contact I make with him... If he's still here to make eye contact with me of course.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Also... I'm glad I'm hearing you call me buddy.
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: That was Cross' idea. eh...
        <br><span class="cts-maximus"></span>: Yeah... at least you're alright now. Wanna come by my office? I'm gonna show you something.
        <br><span class="cts-daud"></span>: Cross... yeah... he still thinks I'm a wimp doesn't he?
