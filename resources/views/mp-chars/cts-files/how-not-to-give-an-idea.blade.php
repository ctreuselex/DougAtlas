        <br>Eagle.
        <br>Ferry and I had a fight. And I think I need some sort of advice on how to handle this kind of things. Since you know, I don't know what I did.
        <br>
        <br>Remember that we had this little talk about what if there's something else out there? Something else outside the city? Well. That idea kind of sunk too deep into her. She now firmly believes that Mirrorplane is not everything there is. As much as I am amazed by her discovering that instantaneous repositioning of one's self or another is possible through Myst Manipulation, her mind is set into trying that... you know... into going through the wall, which we are not even sure really exists. I tried to reason with her asking which could be worst: her failing over and over again proving her wrong and that the city is all there is or her actually going through and who knows what will happen? What if she never comes back? I don't know if I'm being selfish, but as much as I don't want to lose her, it'll be worse if she  end up wasting herself, her whole life, for something that is... too risky with rewards that's might not even worth it. And I know you know that I want to believe her too.
        <br>
        <br>But I lived my whole life in the streets as a rat. Scavenging. Stealing. I know what it feels like to take risks. I want her to do it. But I also don't want to lose her.
        <br>I don't know what to do Eagle. 
        <br>
        <br>PS. Do not reply to this message.

        <br>YOU DIDN'T LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN THE STREET YOU UNGRATEFUL FUKC!!! YOU HAD A FAMILY THAT CARES FOR YOU!
        <br>Sorry. Just taking it out of my system. but SERIOUSLY?
        <br>It's been who knows how long since you ran away from your parents because of whatever reason you may have. And I've met them! They're really great people. They're like someone like me would have dreamt of having as parents! LIKE MAN! I would've have killed you to the have them as my parents!
        <br>
        <br>Anyway, your parents has been together for a really long time, maybe since childhood. They also hasn't broke up, unlike mine who decided it's okay to kill one another, but the point is that maybe... you can talk to them? get some advice? reconnect? because you telling me this things makes me feel all awkward inside and gets me all the urge to punch you in the nuts.
