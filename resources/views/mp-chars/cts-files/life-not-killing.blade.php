        <br>Saved in drafts
        <br>
        <br>So... This is uhmm... what's this guy's name again?
        <br>
        <br>What are you doing?
        <br>
        <br>Just trying something out.
        <br>
        <br>You're recording?
        <br>
        <br>Well, people seem to really enjoy making these recordings I think.
        <br>I wanna know why and how is it even remotely enjoyable.
        <br>
        <br>Don't they just use it to communicate with each other?
        <br>
        <br>Ohh yeah...
        <br>I think it's just for communications, but I don't think it can't also be used for saving your thoughts.
        <br>
        <br>Saving thoughts, maybe that's it?
        <br>Also, Why are we not using something like this. It could make our missions a lot easier.
        <br>
        <br>Because CTs cards are rigged Ri-
        <br>Sorry... They're rigged, the Dominion can know who or where we are just from them.
        <br>
        <br>Ohh... Do you think since we're recording this, that some Psykeepers are probably hunting for us right now?
        <br>
        <br>I don't think thats-
        <br>
        <br>WHAT? YOU'RE RECORDING THIS? TURN IT OFF NOW!
        <br>
        <br>KALL-
        <br>
        <br>[distant female voice] You just threw away our objective.
        <br>
        <br>[distant female voice] Pretty sure we can still find it. Just use your phase-vision-thingy Hers.
        <br>
        <br>[distant female voice] Goodluck with that.
        <br>[distant female voice] This is your fault anyway. Both of you! Grrr.
        <br>[distant female voice] I'll just guar-
        <br>
        <br>Found it!
        <br>
        <br>[distant female voice] THEN TURN IT OFF!!!
        <br>
