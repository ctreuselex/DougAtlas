        FORUM BOARD Title: <b>THEORIST CLUB: The Green Flash!</b>
        <br>Hi Theorist. I was walking late last night, from Geios, when I saw a sudden flash of green light on the sky. Well, I know that the higher ups can easily change the sky to whatever the hell color they want for the sky but this strange light was very different! I don't have pictures for evidence since I don't really run around at night taking photos of shadows. So any ideas?

        Could easily be a reflection of some light from the ground.

        The sky doesn't reflect light silly. it's not a mirror.

        Still could be some sort of random concentrated Myst with witch you just happen to pass by.

        @01coumug which* Well, if it's Myst and it's glowing into a flash like an explosion. Who do you think is this flying man? I have yet to know people who can hover that high.

        I take it more as if its a light from outside the city.

        Oh! I like this idea. Do you think there's really something outside of Mirrorplane? Have you heard of that one guy who said he went out of the wall but returned without his sanity intact?

        Yeah, the dominion probably hid him some where, where no one will be able to question him with how he got out in the first place. Also saying that it's a wall supports my theory of why the sun is flat. I mean, there's probably something outside that is being hidden from us. OR MAYBE, WE ARE THE ONES BEING HIDDEN FROM THE OUTSIDERS! AHH!

        @theBoat Well that's really creepy. What's more creepy tho is the fact that we are already overpopulating the city. What if once we're full, the outsiders will harvest us for our souls! These thoughts are giving me nightmares.

        I still like the theory with the idea that our city is a ship and there's nothing outside of it but more void tho. But then why are we all floating in an endless void? gives me all the mindfucks.
