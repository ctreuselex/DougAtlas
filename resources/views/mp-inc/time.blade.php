        <b class="mp-title">So, how does it really work?</b>
        <br>Seeing as the Sun(Sol) and the Moon(Luna) of Mirrorplane is just disks that rotates, clock-wise, over the city, which ever division they are facing will be considered day or night.
        <br>For Example: If Sol is facing Luminos, then it is day in Luminos and night in Mystos, which is the opposite of Luminos in the city. And in Aeros, it will be afternoon, and dawn in Geios.
        <br>
        <br>Weeks are made up of ten days, and there are only four months, which are the four seasons of; Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring, in that order. Which month it currently is, is determined by which division the Mandalas Catherdral is currently located.
        <br>
        <br>Years are called Revolutions, and is only made off 236 days, 59 days for each month. Days are also 35% longer to make up for the fewer days. Every new revolution is celebrated in Geios called the 'Recurrence'.
        <br>
        <br>Fun Fact: Even with the longer days, there is still fewer days in total per year in Mirrorplane, making everyone to be actually at least 1-3 years younger than their actual age, or even more gap when their older.
