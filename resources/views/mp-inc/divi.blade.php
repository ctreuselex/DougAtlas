                <br><b>Higher Ring | Corporal Works</b>
                <br>Luminos' high ring is an industrial wonder, pumping water from the lower rings and using it as a source of food and as beautiful landmarks such as; waterfalls. It's walls have a lot of open spaces and sand which are very coarse and gets everywhere, students who practices Armagi find such place ideal for their training. It is also the home of Corporal Works, and anyone who are interested in weaponry will always find the best deal in its marketplace.
                <br>
                <br><b>Middle Ring</b>
                <br>Half flooded and warm weather, the middle ring of Luminos as actually an excellent place for vacation, and its people knows that and sells it very well. Boats and bridges are common place here due to the water dividing most part of the lands, and unless they actually want to swim from place to place, taking such routes is pretty much their only way. The middle ring is also where most of Luminos' population live. 
                <br>
                <br><b>Lower Ring</b>
                <br>Most of Luminos' lower ring is submerged in water, only excluding those tiny huts that floats above the actual division which they use for extraculicular fishing and sports. The only way to the underwater division is through tubes that run through the middle ring wall, which is, as every maintenance worker would say, the hardest part of their job. The tube is in fact an elevator and not just a regular tube to which one would expect he would need to jump in, this makes travelling through the tubes very expensive, which only the rich can afford. This results in the lower ring being the richest part of Luminos instead of the higher ring like the other divisions.
                <br>
                <br><b>Luminos Division of the Institute</b>
                <br>The Luminos division of the Institute acquired the ancient form of Myst manipulation; Armagi, the practice of using weapons in conjuction with actual manipulations.

This also, results in many shady businesses and secret organizations, especially in the deeper parts of the streets that the light doesn't reach.
                <br>
                <br><b>Rings of Smoke</b>
                <br>The classification between the rings of Aeros is really blurred, due to their population problems resulting to structural problems, one wouldn't even be able to distiguish if they've left the ring and entered the other. Most of the population are of the working class, working for different companies from the other divisions, also serving as the cheapest laborers in town since they'd rather get paid in coins than not get paid at all.
                <br>
                <br><b>Tall Structures</b>
                <br>Buildings in Aeros are so tall they can be seen from any where in Mirrorplane. This is where they collide with the Dominion who are doing they're best, humane or not, to keep the population of Aeros as low as possible; as the lower their population is, the less likely they will stack a house on top of another and reach the Nimbocolumbus by foot. As chaotic is the upper parts of these buildings seem, the lower parts, where it's always night time, is where the real chaos strives in. 
                <br>
                <br><b>The Great Aeros Fire</b>
                <br>In 1666, a large fire which ate half of what supposed to be the middle ring of Aeros has occured, killing hundreds of people, and leaving thousands homeless and hopeless. Some witnesses says that the fire is caused by a bird-like Mare which was brought up by a cult that worshipped it. Evidences has been gathered and the recovered burned robes and scriptures that are barely readable might lead to it being true. One more evidence is a ground fit for a ritual, which required two sacrifices. Though it is unknown if a ritual actually occured in place, but it sure is in the heart of the fire.
                <br>
                <br><b>Carnival of Madness</b>
                <br>Every two cycles, a the Carnival of Madness lights up within the heart of the Great Aeros Fire to bring people back to its ground. It serves as a remembrance to those who were lost during the times of flames and as a way to liven the place up back from its barren ground.
                <br>
                <br><b>Aeros Division of the Institute</b>
                <br>After Frederick Lemaitre and his first protégé, Jon Horacio, the Aeros division of the Intitute built themselves on Extenebri, the practice of manipulating Myst by itself without a medium. this also served to be really useful to their situation, as with the lack of actual material to use.

                <br>
                <br><b>Higher Ring | Nimbocolumbus</b>
                <br>Nimbocolumbus, the home of the Dominion; consists of mostly Mystos population. It was once what is considered the higher ring of Mystos until Zacharias decided that it needs to go higher and threw the whole place into the air. The only way up to the Nimbocolumbus is through a circular flight of stairs within the Mystos division of the Institute, which also requires extensive indentification protocols, including background check, scanning of criminal records, checking of diseases, scanning of criminal records of your dog, and more, and can take several days to be validated. Plus, losing a thousand of calories from walking up the thousand steps of death. Most would rather not, seeing that almost everyone they'll meet up there are assholes anyway.
                <br>
                <br><b>Middle Ring | Mandalas Cathedral</b>
                <br>The middle ring of Mystos is fairly normal and non-elitist. The middle wall is also where half of the revolving Mandalas Cathedral is located; home of the Children of Mandalas, originally formed by Felix Zacharias and Gliciero Quivince back in 1656 as an external base of operations for their regime, but now serves the polar opposite of what it's supposed to represent.
                <br>
                <br><b>Lower Ring</b>
                <br>Mystos' lower ring has quite the same condition as Aeros, tall buildings and overpopulated. Aeros really can't keep their dirt on themselves they had to drag Mystos as well. However, a mysterious disease had set its foot exclusively on Mystos in the past few cycles, known as \"Rot\". Nobody is sure where or when it came to be, but they are sure that whoever have it, will never be allowed to come in contact with anyone else, ever again.

                <br>
                <br><b>Rings of Gold</b>
                <br>Much like Aeros, all rings of Geios are very alike, but unlike Aeros, the rings are all wealthy with at least four more trees for every person living there. Half forest, half city, though one would assume that with all the leaves and twigs falling on the roads of Geios makes it acceptable to be filthy but it's not. Geios have the most trees per houses in the entire city, are very well educated, and very strict when it comes to taking care of their surroundings. Tree-huggers, they are called, and they'll also let the tree stab you in the face if they see you throwing your trash irresponsibly.
                <br>
                <br><b>Recurssions and Graduations</b>
                <br>Geios is responsible for the \"Shifting\" of the Myst Core to the next Division Pedestal every recurssion. Being reputable of being able to take care of thing gets them that kind of priviledge. They also held the graduation of the students of the Institute during the first of Spring, congratulating them for six cycles of passion, crying, and hard work.
