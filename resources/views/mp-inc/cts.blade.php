        <b class="mp-title">Core Transit System</b>
        <br>Is a massive city-wide network created by the Nexus in 1554.
        <br>
        <br>The CTsystem is deemed to be exclusive to the Higher Ring until Bono Vasili, and his peers shared it with the rest of the population. This lead to the creation of the Dominion which is still in control of the real, full power of the CTsystem.
        <br>
        <br>The CTsystem is located where the Myst Core is, and since there are four actual Myst Cores - one for each Division - every month, the CTsystem is being transported to the current division, this process is maintained by the Institute and is monitored by the Dominion.
