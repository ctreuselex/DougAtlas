        <b class="mp-title">The Dominion</b> | "Bad things happen, especially, if we want it to"
        <br>Founded after the creation of the CTsystem in 1554, by the elites of the Higher Ring who first used the technology.
        <br>
        <br>Was once a simple group of people, researchers and scientists, called The Nexus, who played with the power of the Myst Core in the Heart of the City, they connected everyone in the Higher Ring with their very first creation, the CTsystem. But after Frederick Lemaitre, one of the founders, found a way to use the system to not only influence the people, but also influence and control the city itself, a name rose up to power. Felix Zacharias tried to brought down Lemaitre, who immediately left after seeing what has become of his companions, and transformed the Nexus into becoming the Dominion it is now known as.
        <br>
        <br>Bono Vasili, one of the founders of the Nexus, and a few of his peers, left the Dominion and brought the system successfully to the Middle Ring but failed on his way to bring it to the Lower Ring. Trying to take back the power in which Zacharias failed to take back by himself, Gliciero Quivince, along with Cryo Arvy and Nacer Witfield, built the Mandalas Cathedral over the revolving wall of the Middle Ring, under the name 'Children of Mandalas', which served to facilite what the CTsystem can do over the Middle Ring and limiting it from the Lower Ring.
        <br>
        <br>On 1616, Zacharias used the CTsystem to brought parts of the Higher Ring into a floating platform which he called the 'Nimbocolumbus', now serving as the home of the Dominion. Nimbocolumbus also brought forth the tradition in which the color of the skies is being changed every Reccurence, in order to remind the city of what power the Dominion holds.
        <br>
        <br>Zacharias and Quivince was killed at the same day on 1618, whoever is responsible for the murder of both leaders remain unknown. Though it is rumored that Zacharias was able to survive the attack, and that his body has been preserved deep inside the Nimbocolumbus, and is the one people call the 'King'.

        <b class="mp-title">The Institute</b> | "If you want something, then you came to the right place!"
        <br>The Institute has been around for a long time that nobody really remembers when they first tried manipulating Myst.
        <br>
        <br>However it was on 1480, that the Institute decided to build themselves a place to study and learn in peace, and being mostly made up of people from the Higher Ring, they were able to brought the land surrounding the Myst Core. Nobody dared to go near it, let alone inside the Myst Core, and the fact that they are studying Myst itself, then the place serve a very practical place for their goals.
        <br>
        <br>The Institute is separated based on Mirrorplane's divisions, with each specialiazing in one form of Myst Manipulation. Each division also has their own Heads which controls their own faculty and Psykeepers. The Head of each Division is also responsible for the entire Division and not just for the Institute.
        <br>
        <br>With most of the Institute being from the Higher Ring and Middle Ring with some from the Dominion, who tends to always be the priority of the faculties, it is extremely rare for the Institute to have an applicant from the Lower Rings.

        <br>Originally serving as the hand of the Dominion in their foundation in 1595, the Children of Mandalas became the people serving group they are after Gliciero Quivince died in 1616, along with the disappearance of adviser Nacer Witfield and Ice Queen Cryo Arvy's increasing popularity among the poeple of the Lower Ring. 
        <br>
        <br>The Mandalas Cathedral is constantly revolving around the outer wall of the Middle Ring, completing it's revolution in sync with the Recurrence.
        <br>
        <br>Because of Cryo Arvy's belief in equality, she started the tradition of selecting her Snow Angels from the most gifted from the Middle and Lower Rings. Every decade on winter, The current Ice Queen selects one of her Snow Angels to be crowned as the next in throne, as she prepares herself for her ascending, in which process is unknown of.

        <b class="mp-title">Landar Industries</b> | "Cannot do the wobbly-wobbles? Then shoot them instead!"
        <br>Four years after Landar Seidlitz' death, Sandra, his wife, along with their son Maximus, began the Landar Industries, in 1681, focusing on technology around Myst, generating it and using it for weapons, for Mystics and Mydows alike.
        <br>
        <br>One of the first innovation that came from the Landar Industries are "Automatic Crystal Myst Armament" or ACMA tech, which composed of several guns which fires crystalized rounds of Myst, allowing non-Myst people, or Mydows to be able to protect themselves from all the mumbo jumbos around them.
        <br>
        <br>Another was, the "Mobile Myst Generating Armory" or MMGA tech, an armor that generates it's own Myst, though it still doesn't grant Mydows the power to control Myst, it's still pretty cool! Only one MMGA tech has been created so far, and it's by Maximus Seidlitz and Cristine Liecel. It's creation caused the death of Liecel and made Seidlitz dependent on it, causing him to blackout whenever it turns off. I hasn't been recreated since, but with it's existence, Sandra says "It's completely possible! Simply needs to be worked on still."
        <br>
        <br>Currently on the works are the "Remote Combustible Myst Grenades" or RCMG tech, and "Dynamic Myst Bound Shields" or DMBS tech.

        <br>Founded in 1640 by Helios Skyforge.
        <br>
        <br>Tauroscene Corp. is a Mystic custom weapon creator since it's inception, hailing Helios Skyforge for his use of his father's famed smithery and creative weapon designs. However, due to pride, and basically, their whole business premise, Tauroscene only make their weapons once and based it whole on their client's fighting style, making them unique, one-of-a-kind, and out-of-this-world ultra expensive.
        <br>
        <br>The Tauroscene Corp. helds an annual weapon exhibition every 28th of Spring in which people showcases their Tauroscene weapon in a one-on-one spar, in which the best are being awarded with the Tauroscene Exellence Trophy, complete with a golden replica of their own weapon.

        <b class="mp-title">Corporal Works</b> | "From the people, for the people."
        <br>Has been around at the same time as the Institute. Corporal Works is actually a collective of several manufacturers of weapons for the Mydows.
        <br>
        <br>Before then, they were one of the largest and most influencial organizations in Mirrorplane, even being offered to be a part of the Higher Ring for massive gains in profit, and of course, increasing rate of overthrowing the Higher Ring with their power. That is until the Institute decided that they wanted to have their on weapons and army as well, thus bringing birth to the Psykeepers, or Combat Myst Manipulators, which then brought the organization back to the people of Middle and Lower Ring. Then, their weapons are only being produced and used for crimes or fighting crimes in the Lower Rings, and never regain relevance above those anymore. 
        <br>
        <br>However, the Luminos division of the Institute and the Armagi are promoting the use of Corporal Works for their weapon's efficiency, combat effectiveness, and the fact that the Corporal Works originated from them.

        <b class="mp-title">Midring Republic Times</b> | "The power of words."
        <br>Is a journalist company founded after Bono Vasili brought the CTsystem to the Middle Ring in 1593.
        <br>
        <br>They haven been the center of trusted news althroughout the city, aside from Nimbocolumbus which has their own centered and exclusive around them. Midring Republic Times used the CTsystem to deliver their reports from all around the city to all around the city, and though they mostly create reports they also tend to create random things if there's nothing hot happening or even mock some higher ups for the lulz.
        <br>
        <br>In early 1680s, after the inception of Landar Industries, Midring Republic has been associating themselves with weapons as well. Ending up with their own version of Landar's ACMA guns, and even with lower quality copies of Tauroscene weapons. Their weapons are often regarded as the worst of the worst for their unoriginality and being made from very cheap materials that even the worst of Corporal Works weapons would work better than their Tauroscene-copied weapons. Good thing is no one really consider them as a weapon manufacturer.
