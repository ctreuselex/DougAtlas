                    <br><br>
                    <b>Origin:</b> Was once a noble group of Rudimenti teaching themselves the secrets of the Myst Core, but slowly turned mad with power as they discover about the creation of one of their members; the CTsystem by Frederick Lemaitre. The CTsystem which allowed the entire populace of Mirrorplane to get a glimpse of the power of the Myst Core created a dark void within the Nexus' current leader, Felix Zacharias, who then tried to seize the Myst Core's power solely for the Nexus.
                    <br><br>
                    Zacharias believed that Rudimenti is a only path for Myst Manipulation to grow and that he and his associates conjured a way for their sanctuary, which was part of higher Mystos, to lift into the skies away from anyone trying to meddle in and 'steal' their knowledge. This sanctuary became known as the Nimbocolumbus and the Nexus declared themselves as the Dominion. To further their control over the city, Gliciero Quivince and his fiancee, Cryo Arvy, created the Children of Mandalas and the revolving cathedral of Winter.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The First Story: </b> Several of the inner members of the Nexus disagreed with what Zacharias did to the Nexus to which they revolted against it. Although, Lemaitre is well known as a public enemy of the Dominion due to him trying to stop them from gaining control over the city through the CTsystem, the few others who followed kept their identity a secret and work in the shadows to stop the Dominions grasps.
                    <br><br>
                    Few of these are Bono Vasili, Nacer Witfield, and Cryo Arvy who were able to undermine the Children of Mandalas and made them work against the Dominion. This severely crippled the Dominion's control over the city and costed Quivince his life under Zacharias' displeased rage."),

Felix Zacharias tried to brought down Lemaitre, who immediately left after seeing what has become of his companions, and transformed the Nexus into becoming the Dominion it is now known as.

        <b class="mp-title">Landar Industries</b> | "Cannot do the wobbly-wobbles? Then shoot them instead!"
        <br>Four years after Landar Seidlitz' death, Sandra, his wife, along with their son Maximus, began the Landar Industries, in 1681, focusing on technology around Myst, generating it and using it for weapons, for Mystics and Mydows alike.
        <br>
        <br>One of the first innovation that came from the Landar Industries are "Automatic Crystal Myst Armament" or ACMA tech, which composed of several guns which fires crystalized rounds of Myst, allowing non-Myst people, or Mydows to be able to protect themselves from all the mumbo jumbos around them.
        <br>
        <br>Another was, the "Mobile Myst Generating Armory" or MMGA tech, an armor that generates it's own Myst, though it still doesn't grant Mydows the power to control Myst, it's still pretty cool! Only one MMGA tech has been created so far, and it's by Maximus Seidlitz and Cristine Liecel. It's creation caused the death of Liecel and made Seidlitz dependent on it, causing him to blackout whenever it turns off. I hasn't been recreated since, but with it's existence, Sandra says "It's completely possible! Simply needs to be worked on still."
        <br>
        <br>Currently on the works are the "Remote Combustible Myst Grenades" or RCMG tech, and "Dynamic Myst Bound Shields" or DMBS tech.

        <b class="mp-title">Tauroscene Corporation</b> | "From the smiths of Skyforge!"
        <br>Founded in 1640 by Helios Skyforge, in guidance of his father, Jupiter Skyforge.
        <br>
        <br>Tauroscene Corp. is a Mystic custom weapon creator since it's inception, hailing Helios Skyforge for his use of his father's famed smithery and creative weapon designs. However, due to pride, and basically, their whole business premise, Tauroscene only make their weapons once and based it whole on their client's fighting style, making them unique, one-of-a-kind, and out-of-this-world ultra expensive.
        <br>
        <br>The Tauroscene Corp. helds an annual weapon exhibition every 28th of Spring in which people showcases their Tauroscene weapon in a one-on-one spar, in which the best are being awarded with the Tauroscene Exellence Trophy, complete with a golden replica of their own weapon.

        <b class="mp-title">Corporal Works</b> | "From the people, for the people."
        <br>Has been around at the same time as the Institute. Corporal Works is actually a collective of several manufacturers of weapons for the Mydows.
        <br>
        <br>Before then, they were one of the largest and most influencial organizations in Mirrorplane, even being offered to be a part of the Higher Ring for massive gains in profit, and of course, increasing rate of overthrowing the Higher Ring with their power. That is until the Institute decided that they wanted to have their on weapons and army as well, thus bringing birth to the Psykeepers, or Combat Myst Manipulators, which then brought the organization back to the people of Middle and Lower Ring. Then, their weapons are only being produced and used for crimes or fighting crimes in the Lower Rings, and never regain relevance above those anymore. 
        <br>
        <br>However, the Luminos division of the Institute and the Armagi are promoting the use of Corporal Works for their weapon's efficiency, combat effectiveness, and the fact that the Corporal Works originated from them.

        <b class="mp-title">Midring Republic Times</b> | "The power of words."
        <br>Is a journalist company founded after Bono Vasili brought the CTsystem to the Middle Ring in 1593.
        <br>
        <br>They haven been the center of trusted news althroughout the city, aside from Nimbocolumbus which has their own centered and exclusive around them. Midring Republic Times used the CTsystem to deliver their reports from all around the city to all around the city, and though they mostly create reports they also tend to create random things if there's nothing hot happening or even mock some higher ups for the lulz.
        <br>
        <br>In early 1680s, after the inception of Landar Industries, Midring Republic has been associating themselves with weapons as well. Ending up with their own version of Landar's ACMA guns, and even with lower quality copies of Tauroscene weapons. Their weapons are often regarded as the worst of the worst for their unoriginality and being made from very cheap materials that even the worst of Corporal Works weapons would work better than their Tauroscene-copied weapons. Good thing is no one really consider them as a weapon manufacturer.

        <b class="mp-title">Carnival of Madness</b> | "The tragedy of madness!"
        <br>The remembrace of the Great Fire of Aeros that happened on 1666, in the Middle and Lower of Aeros.
        <br>
        <br>The Carnival of Madness is a group of people from all over Mirrorplane that reminds the people of Mirrorplane about the horrors of Myst Manipulations and its effects on their tiny city. They held a Carnival in the Heart of the Fire, which is still in ashes even for today, every two cycles.  
        <br>
        <br>The Carnival attracts almost everyone and features what they call the 'abominations of Myst'.

        <br>Is a rebel organization lead by an unknown leader. Who or when it was founded is also unknown but their influence began to solidify in the late 1680s.
        <br>
        <br>The Ark is bent on proving the existence of the outside world and that the Myst Core is responsible for the 'Wall' which separates the city from it. They are also convinced that the Dominion and its previous form - whatever it was before its formation in the 1500s - are the ones responsible for Mirrorplane's isolation. For the past cycles, however, the Ark has never made any direct attack on the Dominion itself, but rather attack weapon manufacturers such as the Tauroscene Corp and the Landar Industries. It is believed that they are trying to diminish the power from the Dominion by stealing their weaponry, it is regarded as "foolish" by most though, due to Myst Manipulation, and the fact that the higher ring and the Dominion have the most Mystics, and the need for weapons in combat is very minimal.

        <b class="mp-title">Dark Crusade</b> | "Shun the non-believers"
        <br>The brother organization of the Ark. Its formation was due to the limited access to the main circle of its older brother, and due to the poeple of the lower ring's belief that the city is totally unfair.
        <br>
        <br>The Ark speaks nothing of the presence of the Dark Crusade and they might be trying to deny its creation due to the crusades violent nature. The crusade is well known within the lower ring and even if its purely composed of its people, they are afraid of it, as it represents the ring's absence of humanity.
