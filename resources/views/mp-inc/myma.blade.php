        <b class="mp-title">Material Affinity</b>
        <br>Myst Manipulation is what separates a Mystic to a Mydow. Everyone in Mirrorplane is connected to the source, to Myst, but it's only Mystics who can manipulate Myst, either by itself or through a medium that's called material affinity.
        <br>
        <br>Material Affinity can be very general like fire, frost, air, etc. which are the common ones, or extremely specific and abstract like, time, speed, plants, etc, which is the rarer type, or even raw Myst itself.
        <br>
        <br>A person's material affinity can be directly related to their parents, may even be passed down as a whole, or a mixed concept of both.

        <b class="mp-title">Armagus</b> | "We are without the lack of creativity"
        <br>Or Armagi, is the practice of utilizing one's material affinity in conjunction with weapons.
        <br>
        <br>Used to be the only way of Myst Manipulation until the appearance of the Intitute's Psykeepers in the early 1500s. Still, Armagi is still the most common style used by Mystics from every division and every rings.
        <br>
        <br>Practiced by the Institute's Luminos division.

        <b class="mp-title">Exnihille</b> | "From the void, bring it forth"
        <br>Is the practice of creating material out of Myst itself, often practiced by those who have raw Myst as their material affinity.
        <br>
        <br>Exnihille is a style that mostly consist of Myst crystallization; creating weapons, objects, armors with Myst itself and fight off opponents with extreme versatility and unpredictableness.
        <br>
        <br>Another practice of Exnihille is an uncommon one, called 'Voiding'. Voiding is the process of removing Myst from a particular area, preventing all Mystics from using it to their advantage or being 'Myst Locked' in Mystics' terms. Technology and the city itself can be affected by Voiding, and the fact that it's effects are harsh makes it a taboo among Mystics.
        <br>
        <br>The first Voiding was demonstrated by Frederick Lemaitre, in moment of his departure from the Dominion.

        <b class="mp-title">Maximo</b> | "To connect from the source of everything"
        <br>The most basic practice is Maximo, yet, it is also the hardest to master. Maximo is the use of one's material affinity, without or with minimal use of other sources but Myst. It is often practiced by those whose material affinity can be generated or translated from Myst itself such as fire, lightning, frost, air, combustions, light, etc.
        <br>
        <br>The grand practice of Maximo is called 'Sigilios', which is the creation of the so called 'Celestial Sigils' to connect the user to the ultimate source of Myst, the Myst Core, which grants them unimaginable power for a short period of time.
        <br>
        <br>The main process behind Sigilios, outside of the creation of sigils themselves, is still unknown, and tapping to such great power is considered reckless and irresponsible by most.
        <br>
        <br>Practiced by the Institute's Mystos division.

        <b class="mp-title">Cirkunesi</b> | "The very city is your ally"
        <br>The rarest practice of all, is the Cirkunesi, which is the bringing of the city itself into one's own hands. It is often practiced by those whose material affinity are abstract, or cannot be generated or translated from Myst, and requires an actual object to be manipulated in the first place such as; earth, time, speed, etc.
        <br>
        <br>Why they're so rare are unknown, but Mystics who practice Cirkunesi are valued by almost everyone, especially the Dominion who wants to change the city, in drastic ways, to whatever they seem fit.
        <br>
        <br>Those who can practice Cirkunesi effectively also often add Armagi to their arsenal, as manipulating the environment as well as having a weapon of your own is just badass!

        <br>Practiced by the Institute's Geios division.
